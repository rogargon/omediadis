Although the Internet offers many opportunities to media creation and distribution, there are legal, economic and technologic barriers that avoid it becoming an open medium for media dissemination. The OMediaDis project contributes a platform, based on a formal conceptualization of the legal domain as a Copyright Ontology, whose objective is to facilitate the development of an open semantic copyright management system.

This platform will be able to process licenses, whether commercial or not, in a flexible and low cost way, which will make it affordable for small content providers and professionals. It will also remove entry barriers caused by proprietary systems, while making interoperability easier. Additionally, it will integrate content use tracking instead of the more common encryption protection that makes integration more difficult and does not respect user rights. OMediaDis will also offer content promotion by means of social networking and customer loyalty building mechanisms.

Finally, in order to make it easier for users to reach the platform functionality (final consumers as much as other actors in the value chain), the development is based on a usability and accessibility engineering process model and builds on top of the Rhizomer web application, which facilitates publishing, querying, browsing, editing and interacting with semantic data.

IMPORTANT NOTE: this repository is for the OMediaDis specific components, for the generic user interface over Semantic Web data components refer to http://code.google.com/p/rhizomer
